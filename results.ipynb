We removed tags, citations and most of weird characters from the movie summaries. We unified dates and in some cases removed the complete dates to keep only the year. We cleaned box office data by removing strings or changing them into numerical values and checked the bounds on some field (for example age should not be negative). We removed ids and columns we will mostly not use."

The bar chart shows a clear upward trend in average box office earnings by decade and an increase in movie production. Earnings rose gradually from the 1910s to the 1960s, with a sharper increase starting in the 1970s, likely driven by advancements in technology, global market expansion, and blockbuster productions. The slight dip in the 2010s might be due to the data ending around 2015, capturing only part of the decade.

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis provides an in-depth exploration of cinema-related data, focusing on various dimensions such as genre distribution, gender representation, box office trends, and the evolution of emotions in movies. The insights gained highlight several key aspects of the film industry while revealing areas where data limitations affect our conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Findings:\n",
    "1. **Data Cleaning and Enrichment**:\n",
    "   - A significant portion of the original dataset, including movie summaries and box office data, contained missing or incomplete values.\n",
    "   - Through web scraping, we successfully enriched the dataset, reducing missing values by over 25% for box office data and improving the average quality of movie summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Emotional Evolution in Movies**:\n",
    "   - Emotions in movies follow a consistent narrative arc across genres and continents:\n",
    "     - Negative emotions such as anger, fear, and disgust rise during the initial stages, building tension.\n",
    "     - Joy and neutrality increase toward the conclusion, reflecting narrative resolution.\n",
    "   - The trends suggest that filmmakers across the globe rely on a shared emotional structure to engage audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Genre and Geographic Trends**:\n",
    "   - Drama dominates globally, accounting for 26% of films, followed by comedy and thriller.\n",
    "   - North America leads in film production, contributing the majority of the dataset, with Europe and Asia trailing behind. Other continents, such as South America and Africa, are underrepresented, limiting our ability to generalize findings for these regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Box Office Performance**:\n",
    "   - Our attempt to predict box office performance using a Random Forest Regressor yielded a low R-squared score of 0.124, indicating that the selected features (release date, runtime, categories, continent, and mean emotions) are insufficient for accurate prediction.\n",
    "   - The limited predictive power suggests that other factors, such as marketing budgets, star power, and audience reception, likely play a significant role in box office success.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations:\n",
    "- **Data Imbalance**: The overrepresentation of North American films skews global trends, making it difficult to draw conclusions for underrepresented regions.\n",
    "- **Feature Limitations**: Emotional arcs and basic film metadata, while insightful, are not strong predictors of box office performance without additional contextual factors.\n",
    "- **Incomplete Data**: Despite web scraping, some gaps remain, particularly for smaller film industries in South America and Africa.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Next Steps:\n",
    "1. **Expand the Dataset**: Further scraping and validation for missing data, particularly in underrepresented regions, could improve the robustness of the analysis.\n",
    "2. **Explore Advanced Models**: Incorporating advanced machine learning models or external features (e.g., social media engagement, audience ratings) could enhance box office prediction.\n",
    "3. **Analyze Niche Genres**: Focused studies on niche genres or regional film trends could uncover unique patterns not evident in the broader analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this work lays a foundation for understanding emotional storytelling and genre trends in global cinema, while identifying areas for future research and data enrichment. The results emphasize the universal appeal of emotional arcs in movies and the challenges of predicting commercial success in such a complex and multi-faceted industry.\n"
