We removed tags, citations and most of weird characters from the movie summaries. We unified dates and in some cases removed the complete dates to keep only the year. We cleaned box office data by removing strings or changing them into numerical values and checked the bounds on some field (for example age should not be negative). We removed ids and columns we will mostly not use."

Some key insights from these two plots are that some categories, like movie summaries, have significant gaps that could affect our following analysis. Since our main points of interest are summaries and ratings, we used scraping to remediate the situation. Initially, we considered using box office revenue to evaluate the success of a movie. However, after further deliberation, we decided it wasn’t the most reliable metric for assessing success due to its dependence on external factors like marketing and distribution. Instead, we opted to use ratings as a more representative measure of audience perception and movie quality. Unfortunately, ratings were missing in our dataset, necessitating additional scraping."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis provides an in-depth exploration of cinema-related data, focusing on various dimensions such as genre distribution, gender representation, box office trends, and the evolution of emotions in movies. The insights gained highlight several key aspects of the film industry while revealing areas where data limitations affect our conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Findings:\n",
    "1. **Data Cleaning and Enrichment**:\n",
    "   - A significant portion of the original dataset, including movie summaries and box office data, contained missing or incomplete values.\n",
    "   - Through web scraping, we successfully enriched the dataset, reducing missing values by over 25% for box office data and improving the average quality of movie summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Emotional Evolution in Movies**:\n",
    "   - Emotions in movies follow a consistent narrative arc across genres and continents:\n",
    "     - Negative emotions such as anger, fear, and disgust rise during the initial stages, building tension.\n",
    "     - Joy and neutrality increase toward the conclusion, reflecting narrative resolution.\n",
    "   - The trends suggest that filmmakers across the globe rely on a shared emotional structure to engage audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Genre and Geographic Trends**:\n",
    "   - Drama dominates globally, accounting for 26% of films, followed by comedy and thriller.\n",
    "   - North America leads in film production, contributing the majority of the dataset, with Europe and Asia trailing behind. Other continents, such as South America and Africa, are underrepresented, limiting our ability to generalize findings for these regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Box Office Performance**:\n",
    "   - Our attempt to predict box office performance using a Random Forest Regressor yielded a low R-squared score of 0.124, indicating that the selected features (release date, runtime, categories, continent, and mean emotions) are insufficient for accurate prediction.\n",
    "   - The limited predictive power suggests that other factors, such as marketing budgets, star power, and audience reception, likely play a significant role in box office success.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations:\n",
    "- **Data Imbalance**: The overrepresentation of North American films skews global trends, making it difficult to draw conclusions for underrepresented regions.\n",
    "- **Feature Limitations**: Emotional arcs and basic film metadata, while insightful, are not strong predictors of box office performance without additional contextual factors.\n",
    "- **Incomplete Data**: Despite web scraping, some gaps remain, particularly for smaller film industries in South America and Africa.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Next Steps:\n",
    "1. **Expand the Dataset**: Further scraping and validation for missing data, particularly in underrepresented regions, could improve the robustness of the analysis.\n",
    "2. **Explore Advanced Models**: Incorporating advanced machine learning models could enhance box office prediction.\n",
    "3. **Conduct Detailed Analyses**: Focused investigations into differences across genres, time, and continents could uncover unique patterns in movie dynamics. Additionally, examining the relationship between emotions and factors such as box office performance, reviews, and awards may provide deeper insights into how storytelling elements influence audience reception and commercial success.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this work lays a foundation for understanding emotional storytelling and genre trends in global cinema, while identifying areas for future research and data enrichment. The results emphasize the universal appeal of emotional arcs in movies and the challenges of predicting commercial success in such a complex and multi-faceted industry.\n"
