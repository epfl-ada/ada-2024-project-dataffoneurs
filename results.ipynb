           "Julius Caesar has conquered Britain, but a village in Kent remains independent. One member of the village, Anticlimax, is dispatched to Asterix's village in Gaul to enlist the help of Getafix the druid in providing magic potion for the British rebels. It is decided that his cousin, Asterix, and Obelix should accompany him, to help transport a barrel of the potion; but while beating up a Roman galley in the English Channel, Obelix mentions the mission, which is reported to the Roman high command in Britain.\r\nIn Britain, the barrel containing the potion is confiscated from a pub cellar owned by Dipsomaniax, along with all the barreled \"warm beer\" (bitter) and wine in Londinium, by the Romans, who set about tasting the barrels to find the right one. Soon the whole unit assigned to the testing is hopelessly drunk. Asterix and Obelix steal all the barrels labelled with Dipsomaniax's name, but Obelix drunkenly starts a fight with some passing Roman soldiers. During the commotion a thief steals the cart with the barrels. Anticlimax and Asterix leave Obelix at Dipsomaniax's pub to sleep off his hangover; but while Anticlimax and Asterix go in search of the thief, the Romans capture the sleeping Obelix and Dipsomaniax and raze the pub.\r\nIn the Tower of Londinium, Obelix wakes up and frees himself and Dipsomaniax. The three heroes, after a search, find the potion in use as a pick-me-up for a rugby team. After this team wins their game, the protagonists seize the potion and escape on the river Thames, where the Romans destroy the barrel and release the potion into the water. At the independent village, Asterix eases the Britons' disappointment by feigning to remake the potion with herbs (tea) given to him by Getafix. With a psychological boost, the village prevails against the Romans, and Asterix and Obelix return home to celebrate."

    "\n",
    "Movies are powerful storytelling mediums that evoke a range of emotions. This analysis aims to determine whether movie runtime influences emotional complexity, hypothesizing that longer films, with runtimes exceeding 2 hours, might showcase more intricate emotional arcs. To investigate, we analyzed emotional metrics derived from sentiment analysis of movie plot summaries, correlating these with runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology: measuring emotional complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data sources and preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "We combined sentiment analysis-derived emotional data with metadata on movie runtimes. The dataset included seven primary emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, neutral, sadness, and surprise, extracted from plot summaries. Emotional arcs were standardized to 20 timesteps, ensuring consistency across varying plot lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Emotional complexity metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "To quantify emotional complexity, we calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Amplitude:** The range of emotion values (maximum − minimum) within a movie's emotional arc.\n",
    "- **Standard deviation:** The variability of emotional intensity across the plot.\n",
    "- **Sum of absolute changes:** The cumulative magnitude of emotional transitions between consecutive timesteps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Runtime categorization\n",
    "\n",
    "Movies were grouped by runtime:\n",
    "- **Short movies:** ≤ 120 minutes.\n",
    "- **Long movies:** > 120 minutes.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Emotional complexity vs runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of emotional complexity metrics across runtime categories revealed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Amplitude:** Long movies exhibited slightly higher amplitude values compared to short movies, indicating broader emotional ranges.\n",
    "- **Standard deviation:** Variability was marginally higher in long movies, suggesting more diverse emotional arcs.\n",
    "- **Sum of absolute changes:** Long movies demonstrated slightly larger cumulative emotional shifts, reflecting greater dynamicity in their narratives.\n",

    "<img src=\"src\\scripts\\plots\\results\\correlation_emotional_complexity_1.png\" alt=\"box off per cat\" width=\"1600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these differences, the variations were modest, suggesting runtime alone is insufficient to explain emotional complexity.\n",

    "### Emotion-specific correlation analysis\n",

    "We further analyzed correlations between runtime and emotional complexity metrics for individual emotions:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"src\\scripts\\plots\\results\\correlation_emotional_complexity_2.png\" alt=\"box off per cat\" width=\"1600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Key observations:\n",
    "- **Joy and surprise:** The strongest positive correlation, suggesting longer movies significantly increase variations in this emotion.\n",
    "- **Neutral and disgust:** Moderate correlations, indicating that runtime contributes to broader emotional arcs in these categories.\n",
    "- **Fear, sadness and anger:** Negative correlations, suggesting longer movies significantly decrease variations in this emotion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General insights\n",
    "\n",
    "While longer movies exhibited marginally greater emotional complexity, runtime alone does not sufficiently account for emotional storytelling. The results highlight the importance of narrative structure, genre, and thematic elements in shaping emotional arcs. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis underscores the nuanced relationship between runtime and emotional complexity. Although longer runtimes provide opportunities for more intricate emotional arcs, they are not definitive indicators of emotional storytelling depth. Future research could explore the interaction between runtime, genre, and audience reception to further illuminate the dynamics of cinematic storytelling.\n"

This suggests that the war may have had a specific impact on how filmmakers used emotions to tell stories. To understand this better, we focused on anger and disgust in the detailed graphs. "

    "The graphs show clear patterns for anger and disgust across the two periods. Anger rises steadily before 1914, peaking around the middle of the timeline, and then drops sharply toward the end. This suggests that stories before the war built up tension and conflict before resolving them. During the war years (1914–1922), anger remains strong, showing a higher and more stable intensity. This could reflect the frustrations and conflicts of the wartime period, as filmmakers tried to capture the emotions of a world at war.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, disgust consistently declines in both periods. Before 1914, it starts high but gradually decreases, possibly because early filmmakers used unsettling themes to grab attention. During the war, the drop becomes even steeper, suggesting that audiences had less tolerance for disturbing content while dealing with real-world horrors. Filmmakers might have shifted away from such themes to provide some relief."

    "To analyze the emotional impact of the 9/11 attacks on cinema, we focused exclusively on movies produced in the United States. By examining films from two time periods—1998 to 2000 (pre-9/11) and 2001 to 2003 (post-9/11)—we aimed to minimize the influence of other events and isolate the effects of this pivotal moment. The analysis tracks the normalized evolution of emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, joy, neutral, sadness, and surprise across different genres, providing a detailed view of how storytelling may have shifted during this era."

    "From the first set of graphs, we notice that sadness shows distinct variations before and after 9/11, particularly in the genres of romance and family/animation. This observation led us to narrow our focus to these two genres, as they displayed the most striking emotional shifts. Sadness in family/animation films appears to decrease after the attacks, reflecting a potential trend toward lighter, more uplifting narratives for younger audiences. Conversely, sadness rises in romance films, suggesting a deeper exploration of emotional vulnerability and connection in response to societal grief.\n",

In contrast, sadness in romance films increases during the same period, suggesting a shift toward more poignant and reflective storytelling that resonates with societal mourning. These findings underscore the varied emotional responses of different genres to the same historical event, highlighting the adaptive nature of cinema in addressing collective emotions."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis provides an in-depth exploration of cinema-related data, focusing on various dimensions such as genre distribution, gender representation, box office trends, and the evolution of emotions in movies. The insights gained highlight several key aspects of the film industry while revealing areas where data limitations affect our conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Findings:\n",
    "1. **Data Cleaning and Enrichment**:\n",
    "   - A significant portion of the original dataset, including movie summaries and box office data, contained missing or incomplete values.\n",
    "   - Through web scraping, we successfully enriched the dataset, reducing missing values by over 25% for box office data and improving the average quality of movie summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Emotional Evolution in Movies**:\n",
    "   - Emotions in movies follow a consistent narrative arc across genres and continents:\n",
    "     - Negative emotions such as anger, fear, and disgust rise during the initial stages, building tension.\n",
    "     - Joy and neutrality increase toward the conclusion, reflecting narrative resolution.\n",
    "   - The trends suggest that filmmakers across the globe rely on a shared emotional structure to engage audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Genre and Geographic Trends**:\n",
    "   - Drama dominates globally, accounting for 26% of films, followed by comedy and thriller.\n",
    "   - North America leads in film production, contributing the majority of the dataset, with Europe and Asia trailing behind. Other continents, such as South America and Africa, are underrepresented, limiting our ability to generalize findings for these regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Box Office Performance**:\n",
    "   - Our attempt to predict box office performance using a Random Forest Regressor yielded a low R-squared score of 0.124, indicating that the selected features (release date, runtime, categories, continent, and mean emotions) are insufficient for accurate prediction.\n",
    "   - The limited predictive power suggests that other factors, such as marketing budgets, star power, and audience reception, likely play a significant role in box office success.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations:\n",
    "- **Data Imbalance**: The overrepresentation of North American films skews global trends, making it difficult to draw conclusions for underrepresented regions.\n",
    "- **Feature Limitations**: Emotional arcs and basic film metadata, while insightful, are not strong predictors of box office performance without additional contextual factors.\n",
    "- **Incomplete Data**: Despite web scraping, some gaps remain, particularly for smaller film industries in South America and Africa.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Next Steps:\n",
    "1. **Expand the Dataset**: Further scraping and validation for missing data, particularly in underrepresented regions, could improve the robustness of the analysis.\n",
    "2. **Explore Advanced Models**: Incorporating advanced machine learning models could enhance box office prediction.\n",
    "3. **Conduct Detailed Analyses**: Focused investigations into differences across genres, time, and continents could uncover unique patterns in movie dynamics. Additionally, examining the relationship between emotions and factors such as box office performance, reviews, and awards may provide deeper insights into how storytelling elements influence audience reception and commercial success.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this work lays a foundation for understanding emotional storytelling and genre trends in global cinema, while identifying areas for future research and data enrichment. The results emphasize the universal appeal of emotional arcs in movies and the challenges of predicting commercial success in such a complex and multi-faceted industry.\n"
